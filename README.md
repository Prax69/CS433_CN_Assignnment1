THIS README FILE CONTAINS INFORMATION TO RUN THE CODES FOR PART 1, PART 2 AND PART 3 OF THE ASSIGNMENT <br />
/*

PART 1: <br />
    gcc raw_socket.c -o lsniffer              // ---> To compile the raw_socket.c and generate an executable file named lsniffer  <br />
    sudo ./lsniffer                           // ---> Execute lsniffer <br />
    sudo tcpreplay --mbps 1 -v -i eth0 0.pcap // ---> Run tcpreplay to run packets <br />

PART 2: <br />
    gcc <name-of-your-C-program> -o <name-your-executable>            // ---> To compile your .c file  <br />
    sudo ./ <executable-file>                                         // ---> Execute the compiled file  <br />
    sudo tcpreplay --mbps 1 -v -i eth0 0.pcap // ---> Run tcpreplay to run packets <br />
    Do the same for all sub-parts of Part 2 (twice for d subpart)     <br />
    
    
PART 3: <br />
keep the browser open so it doesn't get stuck. Rest is same as 1 but no need to do tcpreplay instead use some other processes.
